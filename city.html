        <p><h2>Tier*</h2></p>
        <p> The city is made up of a labyrnth of relationships, represented by a faction mechanic. Each notable faction is ranked by Tier—a measure of wealth, influence, and scale. At the highest level are the Tier V and VI factions, the true powers of the city. Your crew begins at Tier 0.
        </p>
        <p>
        You’ll use your Tier rating to roll dice when you acquire an asset, as well as for any fortune roll for which your crew’s overall power level and influence is the primary trait. Most importantly, your Tier determines the quality level of your items as well as the quality and scale of the gangs your crew employs—and thereby what size of enemy you can expect to handle.
        </p>
        <p><h2>Turf</h2></p>
        <p>One way to contribute to the crew’s development is by acquiring turf. When you seize and hold territory, you establish a more stable basis for your rep. Each piece of turf that you claim represents abstracted support for the crew (often a result of the fear you instill in the citizens on that turf).
        </p>
        <p>
        Turf is marked on your rep tracker (see the example below). Each piece of turf you hold reduces the rep cost to develop by one. So, if you have 2 turf, you need 10 rep to develop. If you have 4 turf, you need 8 rep to develop. You can hold a maximum of 6 turf. When you develop and reset your rep, you keep the marks from all the turf you hold.
